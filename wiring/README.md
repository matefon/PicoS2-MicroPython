Connect the PS/2 socket (mini-DIN 6P) pin 1 (data) to GP1 and pin 5 (clock) to GP0
Connect the PS/2 socket pin 3 (ground) to any ground on the Pico
Connect the PS/2 socket pin 4 (vcc) to Pico 3.3V. It is important to NOT connect it to 5 volts, else it will fry your Pi (The keyboard works perfectly with 3.3 volts as well!)


**I accept any help and suggestions.**
